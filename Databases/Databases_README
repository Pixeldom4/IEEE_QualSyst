To my understanding there are a bunch of databases across each of the academic databases. At some point we create a
"master" database of all papers to avoid redundancy, but for now I'm just unloading proquest data here.

If you are adding a large file (and the file is too big for Github), try using Git LFS (Large File Service)
Step #1: Install Git LFS; Run "git lfs install" in the terminal
Step #2: Track the file type you want to upload; ex. <git lfs track "*.csv">
Step #2.5: <git add .gitattributes>
Step #3: Add the file you want to add!
Note: Git LFS is on hold, it will break if we exceed 1.5 gb, which we exceeded, so right now let's just not use it :)

Please add files that we want script to act upon here (if possible). If the file is too large, and we need LFS for it,
we can consider using the 1.5 gb allocation per month, or we can ask Matt if he can pay $5 a month for another 50 gb.
This just makes the script easier to use...
